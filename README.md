Just a simple wrapper for [Procurios.Public](http://techblog.procurios.nl/k/news/view/14605/14863/how-do-i-write-my-own-parser-(for-json).html)

Also Includes CCPrefrences - JSON like applicaiton settings/preferences

Added - I had an idea of self documenting JSON files. Since they don't allow comments, I created a sample in the Demo app that when you save the JSON file, it dumps a key into the file with help text. Follow the instructions and the app works differently. Just an idea

Tossed in a hack for ICollection objects to "compare" them, not sure if it works.
